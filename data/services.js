                    I have worked extensively with React, developing robust and efficient web applications. My
                    experience includes using frameworks and libraries such as NextJS and Express, as well as Bootstrap
                    and Material-UI for interface design. Additionally, I have utilized tools like NPM, Node.js, Bun.js,
                    MongoDB, and WebStorm to optimize the workflow. I also have solid knowledge in HTML, CSS, Sass,
                    Vite, and vitest, which allows me to create complete and well-structured web applications. I have
                    worked with both JavaScript and TypeScript, adapting to the project's needs.
