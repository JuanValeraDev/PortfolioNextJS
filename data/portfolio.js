                    This is a project made with my partner <a href="https://github.com/VictorGlvez" target="_blank">Víctor
                    Gálvez</a>.
                    It is related to countries information. You
                    can search for information about a country, see a gallery of images, make a comparation between two
                    countries and play a quiz about countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project is made with React, Bootstrap, Express and API consumption, like chatgpt 3.5 turbo,
                    restcountries or pexels. It is located on Render.

                    We live in a world where we need to move quickly and iterate on our
                    ideas as flexibly as possible. Building mockups strikes the ideal
                    balance between true-life representation of the end product and ease
                    of modification.

                    Mockups are useful both for the creative phase of the project - for
                    instance when you&lsquo;re trying to figure out your user flows or the
                    proper visual hierarchy - and the production phase when they will
                    represent the target product. Making mockups a part of your creative
                    and development process allows you to quickly and easily ideate.
